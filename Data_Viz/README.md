# Data Visualization Project

## Data Set:
I used the Global Terrorism Database for my data set.
I pared down the data set to remove incidents with a month or day value of 0,
I removed a fair number of the collumns that I would not be using, in order to 
make the size of the file more managable. 

## Feedback:

### D Wood:

* Scale the circles as you zoom ()
* Mousewheel zoom feature (done)
* Clarification of what the colors mean(done)
* Perhaps change the map projection ()

### S Eastman:

* "Add news paper clippings" - Would be great if reasonably accessable, would definitely consider doing this if it were a product
* If possible add a link to more information about each group involved - No reliable data available.
* Make tooltip background more opaque - done

### D Grossman-Laskin:

* Suggested grouping similar attack types with similar colours - Decided not to do this because there I wanted to draw more attention to the various types of attacks, independent of what similarities they may share with other attack types.
* Suggested putting the average number of attacks per year on each country - Again this was not in line with the narrative that I wanted to tell.
* Asked why I was displaying the range of years and not individual years - I told her that I wanted to communicate the change over time of the type of attacks that prevail in different parts of the world.

###Project Reviewer
* Animating from the start is confusing (added a start button)
* Animating the data points being added to the country 
makes it difficult to tell what it going on
* Use Markdown in Readme (done)
* Comment certain code blocks (done)
* Formatting changes for code (done)
